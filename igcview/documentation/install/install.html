<p>IGCview has been written entirely in the internet programming languages Java and HTML, which
means it can be run from a web server or locally on your home PC simply by accessing the
<a href="../../igcview.html">igcview.html</a> file with your browser.  In either circumstance, you have
to configure your PC to allow IGCview access to your local log files, as the default for Java is
no access to any local files.</p>
<p>This configuration is simple, and is explained below.

  <td>IGCview can be bundled with some competition logs on a web site, and I intend to make it
      simple for a competition to preload some logs for display.  Also accessing a website
      of IGCview is more convenient if your only means of access to the internet is via
      a web cafe or your employer, where local install of software may be difficult.  IGCview was
      originally written to be run locally on your PC, but since placing the program on my
      homepage (<a href="http://www.forsterlewis.com/soaring/igcview/igcview_home.html">http://www.forsterlewis.com</a>)
      I have found that means of access very convenient.

  <td>Downloading IGCview to your 'c:' drive improves performance (slightly) depending on the
      speed of your internet connection, and more importantly removes the requirement for an
      dial-up connection each time you run the program - important if you're paying per-call charges, or sitting
      in the middle of an airfield with a laptop.

<h3>This happens if you try to access local log files on your PC without following these instructions first:</h3>

</h2>

<p>Essentially, all you have to do is go to the web page and IGCview is up and running right there.
<font color="green"><strong>However, permissions must be set in your browser to allow IGCview to load your
local IGC files.</strong></font>
The default setting for your browser prevents web (java) application to local files.
This is a standard function of the browser, designed to protect your machine from malicious code
embedded in any web page.  We can allow IGCview to run properly by defining my website as a 'Trusted site'.
The alternative is to download IGCview from my site and 
<a href="#local">run it entirely locally</a>, like any other local
application.
</p>
<p>Here is a set of instructions suitable for Microsoft Internet Explorer - I haven't got around to
creating similar instructions for Netscape or other browsers, but it should be possible to do
something similar.
</p>

<table border="2" cellpadding="5">
<colgoup><col width="45%"/><col/></colgroup>
<tr>
  <td><font color="green"><strong>Step 1.</strong></font><br>
      From the IE menu, access Tools... Internet Options, and click the Security tab.  Then on
      the Security page click on the 'Trusted sites' zone icon, and then click the 'Sites...' button.
  </td>
  <td><img src="ie_internet_options.gif"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><font color="green"><strong>Step 2.</strong></font><br>
      Uncheck the checkbox labelled 'Require server verification (https:) etc.', and
      in the 'Add this Web site to the zone' box type <font face="Courier">http://www.forsterlewis.com</font>.
      Then click the 'Add...' button and then 'OK'.  Back on the 'Internet Options' panel (shown above),
      click on the 'Custom Level...' button.
  </td>
  <td><img src="ie_trusted_sites.gif"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><font color="green"><strong>Step 3.</strong></font><br>
      In the 'Security Settings' panel, scroll down to the Microsoft VM..Java Permissions
      and select 'Custom', which will cause a 'Java Custom Settings' button to appear at
      the bottom of the panel.  Click this 'Java Custom Settings' button.
  </td>
  <td><img src="ie_security_settings.gif"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><font color="green"><strong>Step 4.</strong></font><br>
      On the 'Trusted sites' panel select the 'Edit Permissions' tab and ensure you select
      the following under 'Unsigned Content..Run Unsigned Content':
	<ul>
	  <li>Run in sandbox</li>
	  <li>Under 'Additional Unsigned Permissions' select:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Access to all files..Enable</li>
	      <li>Dialogs..Enable</li>
	      <li>User Selected File Access..Enable</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      The right permissions are now set, and you can click the 'OK' buttons until you are out of
      the menus and back to the normal browser window.
